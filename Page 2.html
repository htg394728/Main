<h1><em>Facts about JoJo</em></h1>
<br>
<br>
<h3>JoJo is somewhat of a parody of Fist of The North Star, a really old anime. Stand users are attracted to other stand users (as in they are always near eachother, you can't go too long without another user being around). </h3>
<br>
<h3>There are a few different variants of stands. there are Ranged stands, which can shoot projectiles and tend to not be very strong physically. There are also close up attacking stands. these stands are much more powerful than most stands, but they can't go very far from the user, and have almost no natural projectiles, and they must use what they have around them as throwable weapons. Then there are remote stands. they can move the farthest from their users, and if it gets hurt or attacked, it won't affect the user at all. There are specific types of moves that can bypass this, but they usually aren't that good for damaging people. There are passive stands, which don't fight at all. They are just kind of there for company and supporting the user mentally. Finally, there are support stands. These are stands that can fall into any of the previous catagories, but are considerably weaker than regular stand types and mostly have special abilities or healing to make them a support type.</h3>
<br>
<h3>all of the main characters consist of Jonathan Joestar, Joseph Joestar, Jotaro Kujo (still from joestar family), Josuke Higashikada, Giorno Giovanna, Jolyne Cujo (Jotaros daughter). there is also Jhonny Joestar and Geppi/Josuke Higashikada (part 8), but i don't know enough about them so we will skip parts 7 and 8.</h3>

<p><em>These are the characters we will focus on.</em></p>
<br>
<h3>I only say we are skipping those, because they are from an alternate universe. I haven't read those parts yet, but they are really confusing, because they re-use names from old parts. so to avoid confusion, they will be excluded.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>So, Jonathan and Jospeh are up first. Jonathan came from a rich family, but was pretty much replaced by a new character named DIO. DIO was living with his dad, but poisoned his dad to kill him. then he went to the Joestars mansion to become the richest man on the planet, by poisoning Jonathans father and taking the inheritance for himself. but he gets found out, and turns himself into a vampire to gain immortality. Then Jonathan was introduced to a man named William Zeppeli, who teaches him how to use the ripple, or "hamon", almost like a burning lightning attack and vampires are weak to it because it almost matches the heat of the sun. After multiple fights, DIO is technically defeated, but Jonathan dies first and DIO steals his body and spends a couple hundred years under water to regenerate. </h3>
<br>
<h3>Then comes Joseph, He is Jonathans great grandson and must fight more vampire type beings using Hamon. But he is not as well trained as Jonathan was, so he can't beat them. so he meats some other hamon users and hamon masters, trains up his hamon, then starts attacking. And after Multiple fights and one hand taken off, he beats the strongest member and wins. </h3>
<br>
<h3>Jotaro is next. He is an edgy highschooler delinquent who put himself into jail, because he thought his stand was an "evil spirit". but after being forced out by another stand user, he was talked to about how his stand works, and how he only got it because DIO got out of the coffin. Then his mom starts developing her own stand, and because she has no fighting spirit, it is killing her, And they only have 50 days to get to egypt to kill DIO and get rid of her stand. So after 49 days and some time, DIO is killed and Jotaros mom is saved. Then Jotaro reads a diary that dio dropped. This is important for part 6 story</h3>
<br>
<h3>Josuke Higashikada is pretty much just a normal highschooler with a stand, not a whole lot more to his story, but he does manage to kill a murderer of 15 or so years who has been hiding out in the town of morioh. And because he is a part of the Joestar bloodline, he was effected by DIO, and also only had 50 days to live. but he survived and developed his stand. And now his hairstyle and clothes are based off of someone who helped his mom get him to a hospital. and he can't help but go into a blind rage when anyone says ANYTHING bad about his hairstyle</h3>
<br>
<h3>Giorno Giovanna is in italy, and is trying to become a part of a gang. Because the organization in his city is giving drugs to kids and he doesn't like that. So Giorno moves up in the ranks with his "Gold Experience" support type stand. and kills the boss using an upgraded version of his stand.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Finally, we have Jolyne Cujo. She spelled her name wrong to further distance herself from her father (Jotaro) after he left her and her mom to protect them from enemy stand users. Jolyne was in prison for a while, but she gets out with a few friends who are also stand users, and they leave. as time goes on they meet a man named Enrico Pucci who needs to steal Jotaros memories in order to read the diary Jotaro read at the end of part three. so he does that, upgrades his stand so he can now manipulate gravity, and then upgrades it again, giving it unlimited speed, and he uses that stand to reset the universe. Jotaro ended up having a choice. in half a second, he had to make a choice to either save the universe, or save his daughter. he chose his daughter.</h3>
